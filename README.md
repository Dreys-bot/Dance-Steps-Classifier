## üìù Summary of Project

### Data collection
Dance videos were collected for each style (afrobeat, classical, hip-hop). These videos were cut into key frames representing each movement, and the labels were digitally encoded.

### Model conception
A convolution model (CNN) was designed and trained on the data. It comprises:

10 training epochs
Batch size of 32
Training rate of 0.0005
Results displayed every 40 iterations
GPU execution
Training and test loaders
3 classification classes: Afrobeat, Classical, Hip-hop
Adam optimizer
Scheduler decrementing learning rate
CrossEntropyLoss loss criterion
